In Java, create separate spring profile for test and deployed. and create two configurations. keep deployed in test source location.

In test configuration, not only initialize datasource, but also initialize flyway. 
use flywaytest anotation to initialize db.

In deployed configuration just create datasource.

Externalize datasource settings from maven, so that they can be shared in spring and not duplicated.
